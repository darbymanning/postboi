/**
 * Klaviyo provider — https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/create_event
 *
 * Klaviyo has no transactional send endpoint. What it has is **events**: you file one
 * against a profile, a flow in Klaviyo is triggered by it, and the flow's email is what
 * goes out. So this provider posts the send as an event — `subject`, `html`, `text`,
 * `from` and the recipient's `name` arrive as event properties for the flow's template to
 * place, and a [batch](https://docs.postboi.app/bulk) with `data` fills `{placeholders}`
 * before they go.
 *
 * Two things follow from that, and neither is hidden: **a flow has to exist** for the
 * metric (nothing is sent until one does, and Klaviyo answers 202 either way), and the
 * mail is composed in Klaviyo, so `cc`, `bcc`, attachments, `headers`, `tags`,
 * `scheduled_at` and `tracking` have no equivalent and are dropped. One recipient per
 * event; `idempotency_key` is forwarded as the event's `unique_id`, which is what makes a
 * retry file the same event rather than a second one.
 *
 * The key is a **private** key (`pk_…`) — a public site id can't create events.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import Klaviyo from "postboi/klaviyo"
 *
 * const mail = new Klaviyo({ api_key: KLAVIYO_API_KEY, metric: "Password reset" })
 * await mail.send({ to: "contact@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "<p>Hello world</p>" })
 * ```
