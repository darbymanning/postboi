/**
 * The framework-agnostic webhook handler — `receive()` wrapped in the response contract

 *
 * Next.js route handlers, Cloudflare Workers and plain fetch handlers pass a web
 * `Request`; SvelteKit, Astro and Remix pass a context object carrying `.request`. One
 * handler accepts both, so the same line works in all of them:
 *
 *     export const POST = webhook((event) => { … })
 *
 * Frameworks that wrap the request deeper (Hono keeps it at `c.req.raw`) unwrap in
 * place: `app.post("/webhooks", (c) => webhook(handler)(c.req.raw))`.

/**
 * Build a request handler that receives provider delivery-event webhooks: verifies the

 * Responses are what providers expect: `200 {received}` on success, `401` on a failed
 * signature, `400` on an unparseable payload, and `500` when your handler throws — so
 * the provider retries. SNS subscription handshakes (SES, Scaleway) confirm themselves,
 * and a provider that checks the endpoint with a GET before subscribing (Meta) gets its
 * challenge echoed — route `GET` to the same handler for those.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Next.js app/webhooks/route.ts — and the identical line is an Astro APIRoute, a
 * // Remix action, a SvelteKit +server.ts export or a Worker fetch branch.
 * import { webhook } from "postboi/webhooks"
 *
 * export const POST = webhook(async (event) => {
