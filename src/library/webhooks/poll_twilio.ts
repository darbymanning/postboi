/**
 * Twilio poll adapter — delivery receipts for SMS and WhatsApp.
 *
 * Twilio *can* push status callbacks, but only per message: the URL is set when the
 * message is created, so receiving them means every send having somewhere to call back
 * to. Polling the Message resource needs nothing set up at send time and no public
 * endpoint at all, which is what makes delivery receipts work the same way for a script
 * on a laptop as for a deployed app.
 * https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/api/message-resource
 *
 * One adapter covers both channels because Twilio has one Message resource for both:
 * a WhatsApp message is the same row with `whatsapp:` in front of its addresses. The
 * `channel` on each event says which, and the number lands in `phone` — never in
 * `email`, which stays what its name says.
 *
 * **The window is trailing, not incremental.** Twilio filters the list by `DateSent`,
 * but what changes over a message's life is its *status* — a message sent last night
 * and delivered this morning still has last night's `DateSent`. So every poll asks for
 * the last 24 hours rather than "since the last poll", and the cursor's `seen` map is
 * what makes that cheap: a message is only emitted when its status is different from
 * the one last seen, so the same row can be listed a hundred times and produce one
 * event per real transition.
 *
 * **Inbound replies are read for one thing: an opt-out.** The same list carries what
 * people text back, and a reply that is just "STOP" (or any of the standard keywords —
 * see `is_opt_out`) is an `unsubscribed` event for that number, on whichever channel
 * they replied over. That is the whole of it — a conversation is not a delivery event,
 * and everything else somebody writes stays in Twilio for the code that reads replies.
 * Twilio's own opt-out handling still applies where it exists (US and Canadian long
 * codes); this makes the fact reach *you*, so a suppression can be written wherever
 * you keep them. An alphanumeric sender can't be replied to at all, so nothing arrives.
