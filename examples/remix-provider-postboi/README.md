# Remix × Postboi

A minimal Remix (v2, Vite) contact form that turns a submission into a tidy HTML
email via [postboi](https://docs.postboi.app) on the Postboi provider. A hidden
`_reply_to` field (mirrored from the submitted email) means you can reply
straight from your inbox.

## Set up

```sh
bunx postboi init   # writes .env with your POSTBOI_TOKEN
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.

## How it works

- **`app/routes/_index.tsx`** — the `<Form>` carries hidden `_subject` and
  `_reply_to` fields (`_reply_to` mirrors the email via `useState`) and posts to an
  `action` that just calls `mail({ body })`. postboi extracts the `_`-prefixed
  control fields and renders the rest into an HTML table (the `group→field` names
  become grouped sections).
- **`postboi.config.ts`** — selects the provider (`postboi` = the Postboi provider) and
  the default recipient for contact-form notifications.

Learn more at the [postboi docs](https://docs.postboi.app) and
[the Postboi provider](https://postboi.app).

## Beyond the form

The contact form is the classic; the rest of postboi wires in the same way:

- **`POST /webhooks`** — provider delivery events (delivered, opened, bounced, …),
  signature-verified and normalized. Set `<PROVIDER>_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and point your
  provider's webhook here.
- **`POST /notify`** — the other channels: `sms()`, `whatsapp()` and `slack()` from one
  endpoint. `{ "channel": "sms", "to": "+447700900123", "message": "…" }` — in
  development SMS and WhatsApp are logged, not sent.
